TODO App : 

I'm thrilled to share my latest project - a sleek and intuitive To-Do App built using Flutter!

• App Features:

Two Pages:

All To-Dos: View all your tasks in one place, sorted by date and time for easy management.

Add New To-Do: Quickly add new tasks to stay organized and productive.

• Technologies & Packages Used:

Google Fonts: Enhancing the app's visual appeal with beautiful typography.

Shared Preferences: Ensuring your to-dos are stored locally and persist between sessions.

Provider: Efficient state management for a seamless user experience.

Liquid Swipe: Adding a fun and engaging swipe animation for smooth navigation.

• Sorting by Date & Time: Never miss a deadline! The app sorts your tasks by date and time, so you always know what's next.

This project has been a fantastic journey in leveraging Flutter's powerful ecosystem to build a functional and visually appealing application. I can't wait to explore more and bring even more exciting features to this app.
